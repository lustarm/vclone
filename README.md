## **Custom Command-Line Text Editor**

### **Overview:**
Build a minimalist command-line text editor from scratch. It will mimic the basic functionality of editors like Nano or Vim but designed as a lightweight, customizable tool.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Text Navigation:**
   - Move the cursor with arrow keys.
   - Page up/down functionality.

2. **Editing Capabilities:**
   - Insert, delete, and backspace support.
   - Line wrapping and scrolling.

3. **File Operations:**
   - Open and save files.
   - Detect and display unsaved changes.

4. **Syntax Highlighting:**
   - Basic syntax highlighting for a specific language (e.g., C or Python).
   - Customizable color schemes.

5. **Search Functionality:**
   - Find and replace strings in the text.
   - Highlight matches during search.

6. **Configuration:**
   - Support for a simple config file to set themes, keybindings, or other preferences.

### **Challenges to Tackle:**
- Handle raw input mode (turn off line buffering and echo).
- Efficiently redraw the screen using low-level terminal manipulation.
- Optimize memory usage for large files.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Language:** C or Rust (Rust would help with memory safety while C offers full low-level control).
- **Libraries:**
  - For C: `ncurses` or raw terminal handling via `termios`.
  - For Rust: `crossterm` or `termion`.

### **Advanced Features (Optional):**
- Undo/Redo functionality.
- Multiple buffers (tabs) for editing several files simultaneously.
- Mouse support for navigation.
- Support for plugins written in Lua or another scripting language.
